# <a name="conclusion">7</a> Conclusion

In this paper, we present Sage, which is a new way of data exchange and API design. We first give an overview, then introduce principles, concepts behind Sage; after that we dive deeply into its components. We believe that Sage can perform well in terms of both developer experience and performance under heavy production-load because of its simplicity, lightness and flexibility.
