# <a name="reference-implementations">6</a> Reference Implementations

To clarify the desired and ideal outcome of this proposal, we built reference server and client implementations. Both of them should be ready-to-go and is used on the production at Dorkodu.

*— As of June 18, reference implementations are under development, but you should have a look at the links below for the real-time development progress. We appreciate your feedback.*

- ### Sage Server

    You can see [here](https://github.com/dorkodu/sage.php) the reference server implementation written in PHP.

- ### Sage Client

    You can see [here](https://github.com/dorkodu/sage.js) the reference client implementation written in JavaScript.

    > #### Note
    >
    > This document does NOT focus on and specify any certain rules about the client. However, we are creating a web client with JavaScript, for our own needs. And it can be considered as a *“reference”* for the community.
