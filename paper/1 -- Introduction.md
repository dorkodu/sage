# <a name="introduction">1</a> Introduction

This is the specification for Sage; an open protocol for query-based data exchange and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing business logic and data. Sage is originally created at Dorkodu especially for APIs, to simplify the communication for data interactions between different layers of software. 

Sage is a new and evolving protocol, and is not complete. Significant enhancement will continue in future editions of this specification. The development of this open standard started in 2020.

The latest working draft of this protocol can be found on [Sage’s website](https://libre.dorkodu.com/sage/).

Your use of this “Specification” may be subject to other third party rights. THIS SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” The contributors expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification. The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Specification is assumed by the Specification implementer and user.

### Conformance

A conforming implementation of Sage must fulfill all normative requirements. Conformance requirements are described in this document via both descriptive assertions and key words with clearly defined meanings.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative portions of this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119). These key words may appear in lowercase and still retain their meaning unless explicitly declared as non‐normative.

A conforming implementation of Sage may provide additional functionality, but must not where explicitly disallowed or would otherwise result in non‐conformance.

#### Conforming Algorithms

Algorithm steps phrased in imperative grammar (e.g. “Return the result of calling resolver”) are to be interpreted with the same level of requirement as the algorithm it is contained within. Any algorithm referenced within an algorithm step (e.g. “Let completedResult be the result of calling CompleteValue()”) is to be interpreted as having at least the same level of requirement as the algorithm containing that step.

Conformance requirements expressed as algorithms can be fulfilled by an implementation of this specification in any way as long as the perceived result is equivalent. Algorithms described in this document are written to be easy to understand. Implementers are encouraged to include equivalent but optimized implementations.

### Non-normative Portions

All contents of this document are normative except portions explicitly declared as non‐normative.

> This is an example of a non-normative explanation, or author’s opinion.

Examples in this document are non‐normative, and are presented to help understanding of introduced concepts and the behavior of normative portions of the specification. Examples are either introduced explicitly in prose (e.g. “for example”) or are set apart in example or counter‐example blocks, like these :

```js
// This is an example of a non-normative code sample.
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Code examples are for providing real-life samples, but does not have to be from a real implementation. We created reference implementations, and highly recommend you checking out them.

Notes in this document are non‐normative, and are presented to clarify intent, draw attention to potential edge‐cases and pit‐falls, and answer common questions that arise during implementation. Notes are either introduced explicitly in prose (e.g. “**Note :**“) or are set apart in a note block, like this:
