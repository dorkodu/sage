## Overview

This is a Working Draft of the Specification for Sage, a query-based data exchange protocol for APIs created at Dorkodu.

The target audience for this specification is not the client developer, but those who have, or are actively interested in, building their own Sage implementations and tools.

In order to be broadly adopted, Sage targets a wide variety of mediums such as backend environments, frameworks, and languages, which will necessitate a collaborative effort across projects and organizations. This specification serves as a compass for this goal.
