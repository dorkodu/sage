# sage

## intro

sage allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs, without a query language, schema, or code generation.

### features

- ✅&nbsp; well-tested and production ready.
- 🔐&nbsp; full static type safety & autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs and errors.
- ❌&nbsp; no query language, schema, code generation, run-time bloat, or build pipeline.
- 🍃&nbsp; light – sage has zero dependencies and a tiny client-side footprint.
- 🔗&nbsp; work with relational, graph-like data simply.
- 🔋&nbsp; batteries included – reference implementations in javascript.
- 🗽&nbsp; liberating developer experience.
- ⏳&nbsp; fast, thanks to sophisticated simplicity :)
- 📨 infinite resources with one request.

### overview

this is the working draft for **sage**, a data exchange protocol for APIs, and reference implementations of a runtime and capable of executing queries with your existing data and business logic. the [specification](https://libre.dorkodu.com/sage/paper) is open source; created and governed @ [dorkodu](https://dorkodu.com).

## quickstart

⏳ — work in progress.

## protocol

the sage specification paper (we call it shortly _the paper_) is edited in the markdown files found in [**/paper**](./paper) folder.
the latest working draft and releases of the paper can be found at this repository.

the target audience for the protocol specification are not the product developers; but those who have, or are actively interested in, building their own sage implementations and tools.

in order to be broadly adopted, we want sage to support wide variety of platforms, which will necessitate a collaborative effort across projects and communities.

this specification serves as a compass for implementation and development efforts of sage.
