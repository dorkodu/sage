## Overview

This is the Working Draft of the Specification for Sage, a query-based data exchange protocol for APIs, and a runtime capable of executing those queries with your existing data and business logic. The [specification](https://libre.dorkodu.com/sage/paper) is open source; created, designed and governed by [Dorkodu](https://dorkodu.com).

The target audience for this specification are not the product developers; but those who have, or are actively interested in, building their own Sage implementations and tools.

In order to be broadly adopted, Sage protocol targets supporting wide variety of mediums such as backend environments, frameworks, and languages, which will necessitate a collaborative effort across projects and communities. This specification serves as a compass for implementation and development efforts of Sage.
