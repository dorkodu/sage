# Sage

The Sage specification is edited in the markdown files found in [**/paper**](./paper) folder.

The latest working draft of the specification can be found at this repository.

Sage protocol’s specification paper (we call it shortly *the Paper*) and its releases can be found at [libre.dorkodu.com/sage/paper](https://libre.dorkodu.com/sage/paper).

## Overview

This is the working draft of the specification for Sage, a query-based data exchange protocol for APIs, and a runtime capable of executing those queries with your existing data and business logic. The [specification](https://libre.dorkodu.com/sage/paper) is open source; created and governed by [Dorkodu](https://dorkodu.com).

The target audience for this specification are not the product developers; but those who have, or are actively interested in, building their own Sage implementations and tools.

In order to be broadly adopted, Sage protocol targets supporting wide variety of platforms, which will necessitate a collaborative effort across projects and communities. This specification serves as a compass for implementation and development efforts of Sage.
